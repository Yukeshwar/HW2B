For HW02B, inspired by Yayoi Kusama’s Dots Obsession, I introduced more color variety and altered the composition to make it more dynamic. I used random positioning, sizing, and color selection for the shapes, and alternated between circles and rectangles to add variety. The background was darkened to enhance contrast, making the colors pop. Similar to Malevich’s work, the shapes are centered on the canvas, but I added my personal touch by creating a more chaotic, lively pattern. Like in HW02A, I used dynamic canvas sizing with windowWidth and windowHeight to ensure the piece fits any screen.
